## Generator Screaming Bones
**React + TypeScript Project Generator**

Yeoman generator implementing Screaming Architecture principles with opinionated tooling setup including Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and optional Tailwind CSS integration. Organizes code by business domain rather than technical layers, creating self-documenting project structures.

**Key Accomplishments**

- Developed automated scaffolding using Yeoman + Node.js eliminating repetitive React + TypeScript project setup
- Implemented domain-driven architecture with ESLint 9 + Prettier 3.x enforcing consistent patterns across projects
- Published NPM package with 300+ downloads reducing project initialization from hours to minutes
